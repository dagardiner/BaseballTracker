# BaseballTracker
is a Chrome Extension to allow real-time score tracking of MLB games.  It pulls data from the MLB scoreboard data source, and displays the data for your selected team, in your selected time zone.  During games, it updates more frequently to get real-time, in-game data about the score, inning, pitchers, etc.  This extension was a branch of one of my other extensions, Is There a Cubs Game Today.  I found that there was a group of people that cared about the game - not just being inconvenienced by it - so I made this, and added support for all teams rather than just the Cubs.
